# Quasipilot Harness

Lightweight LangChain coding agent harness.

The current implementation includes the core harness, driver agent, compaction,
session persistence, telemetry, and the Textual CLI.

## Development

```bash
./setup.sh
conda activate quasipilot-harness
python -m pytest
```

The compaction module loads `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from the repository `.env` file
when using the default Gemini-backed LangChain adapter.

Run the CLI with:

```bash
quasipilot
```
